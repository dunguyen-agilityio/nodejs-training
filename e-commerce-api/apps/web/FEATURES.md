# E-Commerce API - Feature Documentation

This document summarizes the features implemented in the **web** application of the e-commerce monorepo.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Integration**: Powered by [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/).
- **Middleware**: Configured via `proxy.ts` (Next.js Proxy convention) to intercept requests and protect routes.
- **Custom Pages**: Dedicated `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` pages utilizing Clerk components.
- **Admin Protection**: Server-side utility `checkAdmin` to restrict access to the `/admin` route.
- **Persistence**: User session and metadata are used throughout the checkout and order history flows.

## 2. Storefront Features
- **Product Catalog**:
    - Responsive grid display with optimized images.
    - **Search**: Real-time search by product name.
    - **Category Filtering**: Dynamic filtering based on product categories (e.g., Apparel, Electronics, Home).
    - **Sorting**: Support for sorting by Price (Asc/Desc), Name (A-Z/Z-A), and Stock levels.
    - **Pagination**: Server-side pagination for efficient data loading.
- **Product Details**:
    - Dynamic routing at `/products/[id]`.
    - Detailed view including description, price, category, and stock status.
- **Shopping Cart**:
    - Context-based state management (`CartContext`).
    - LocalStorage persistence (cart remains after page refresh).
    - Add/Remove items and update quantities directly in the cart.

## 3. Checkout & Orders
- **Checkout Flow**:
    - Multi-section form: Contact Info, Shipping Address, and Payment Details.
    - **Validation**: Strict client-side validation using `react-hook-form` and `zod`.
    - **Order Processing**: Server Action handles order creation and cart clearing.
- **Order History**:
    - User-specific order history at `/orders`.
    - Detailed breakdown of order date, status, items purchased, and totals.

## 4. Admin Panel
- **Dashboard**: High-level metrics showing Total Products, Total Inventory count, and Total Inventory Value.
- **Product Management**:
    - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface.

    - **Status Management**: Admins can update order status (Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled) via Server Actions.

## 5. UI/UX & Design System
- **Theming**:
    - Robust **Dark/Light Mode** support using `next-themes`.
    - Modern color palette based on CSS variables (shadcn-like system).
    - Mode toggle component in the header.
